TeKBC (Technical KBC)

TeKBC is like a KBC game with technical/programming questions

All the questions are written in a "Quiz.txt" file and questions are selected at random



The highlighting feature of this game is:

It has a real clock timer running like in the original KBC game. So, if you don't answer the question in the given time. Then, you will run out of time and lose the game



Two lifelines have also been added to make the game more interesting:

50-50: you can choose two options

SKIP: you can request for a change of the question


PS: All the error checking has been taken care of for the cases like invalid input
